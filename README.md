# Introduction
A sample project to test technical brilliance amongst our interview candidates
Implement the following specification as near as possible to a production application.

This should include significant thought towards architecture and extensibility and any other activities that would happen in developing a production ready application for a client.

You may contact us to ask questions or clarification.

# Project Overview

Uprise has an in-office foosball table. In order to settle the often-asked question of who is the foosball champion, the team has elected to store the results of every game. To facilitate this, process a new system will be built. The Uprise Foosball Ranking System.

## Requirements

### User Stories
The key features of the Solution may be:

 1. As a **user** record the results of matches (no login requirements)
 - Able to enter the participants and the winner(s)
 - Assume the date of entry is the date of the match
 - Handle X vs X matches (1v1, 1v2, 2v2 etc)

 2. As a **user** I can view the win rates
 - The overall win loss rate of a participant
 - The win loss rate of a participant against another specific participant

## Bonus goals

 1. Host it live somewhere
 2. Use a graphing API to show the win rates vs time


## Steps

 1. Please fork this repo
 2. Build your solution
 3. When complete please create a pull request back into this repo

**Please use any relevant technologies in the Uprise stack to demonstrate your expertise. E.g. react, redux, scss with BEM**
